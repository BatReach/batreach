    {
      "question": "What should I do if I find an injured or orphaned bat?",
      "answer": "Don't touch it! You must be vaccinated to handle bats, although diseases are rare in bats, do not approach it just in case. Best thing to do is to keep an eye on it, call FNQ Wildlife Rescue (https://www.fnqwildliferescue.org.au/) and give them as much information as possible so they can arrange for it to be collected and brought to us or another experienced carer."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are bats commonly injured/orphaned, what should I be looking for?",
      "answer": "Megabats of all species come to grief on barbed wire fences, with netting and powerlines, keep an eye out when driving around as they may still be alive or have babies with them. Other unfortunate ways bats get hurt is by being hit by a car or attacked by cats and dogs.\n\n Microbats are more likely to come into the house and fail to find their way out again, usually hitting ceiling fans. At the later stage of baby season, a lot of young microbats fly out for the first time and manage to get into all sorts of bother."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about Paralysis Tick?",
      "answer": "Paralysis Tick is one of the biggest problems in tropical north Queensland, as bats have near to no resistance to the toxin injected by the tick.\n\n Tick bats will usually be hanging low in the tree or on the ground, often with babies. Unfortunatly, many bats don't survive after being bitten but the orphan can still be saved."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about other native wildlife?",
      "answer": "With any wildlife, being sick, injured or orphaned is very stressful. Best thing to do with orphans is to keep the animal Warm, Dark and Quiet. Do not feed it.\n\n The same goes for adult animals, call wildlife rescue. \n\n With all wildlife, relieving stress is vital."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I give first-aid or give it something to eat?",
      "answer": "Bats can give a nasty bite when stressed, even if vaccinated, it is best to let an experienced rescuer handle the animal. Do not attempt to give first aid unless under instructions from someone experienced.\n\n Treating wildlife like a domestic animal by trying to comfort it and talk to it will cause unncessecary stress. Do no feed it! Native wildlife and bats have specific dietry needs, and the wrong foods can cause illness or death."
    },
    {
      "question": "I've hit an animal with my car, what do I do?",
      "answer": "If the animal is still alive, call FNQ Wildlife Rescue or if you have something appropriate to transport it in, depending on the size and species, take it to the nearest vet. If the animal has unfortunatly died, check for a pouch, as a lot of native wildlife are marsupials, young joeys in the pouch will be protected from the force of the car by their mothers body and so survive. If there is a joey, wrap it up in a towel or jumper and take it to the nearest vet to have it taken to the nearest carer."
    },
    {
      "question": "I've checked the pouch and theres a joey, what should I do?",
      "answer": "If the joey is unfurred, it will need to be wrapped up and kept at a steady temperature, ideally, put the wrapped up joey into your shirt and hold against your chest. Your heartbeat and warmth will keep it calm until you can get it to a carer.\n\n Resist the urge to cuddle it, talk to it, keep it! Yes they are cute but they need serious 24hour care.\n\n If the joey has fur, depending on the size and species, holding it in your shirt again can keep it calm, otherwise put it into a box or hold it securely until you can pass it on. \n\n It is illegal to keep any native wildlife without a permit, any animals you find need to be passed onto registered carers."

      "question": "Tell me more about Kuranda, QLD",
      "answer": "Kuranda, Village in the Rainforest, is a beautiful little tourist village surrounded by World Heritage Rainforest.\n\n There are many things to do during your visit to the village, there are several little wildlife, bird and butterfly centres, markets, shops and heaps of places to eat as well as several art and aboriginal gallerys.\n\n There is also a wonderful walk through the rainforest called the JumRum walk that will take you from one end of Kuranda to the other or you can continue further through to the Barron Falls. But if you are feeling lazy, there is a Barron Falls Shuttle Bus next to the Fire Station!\n\n  There are several ways to get up here to Kuranda, there is the [Scenic Railway](http://www.ksr.com.au/Pages/Default.aspx) or the [SkyRail](http://www.skyrail.com.au/), or the more traditional car, bus or taxi.\n\n  When you arrive in Kuranda, we reccommend heading to the [Kuranda Visitor Information Centre](http://www.kuranda.org/?s=1) where the helpful staff will be able to direct you in the direction of BatReach or anywhere else you want to visit during your visit."

      "question": "How common is Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABL)?",
      "answer": "ABL was first identified in 1996, a close relative to the virus found overseas; Rabies.\n\n  It was in these early days, before awareness of the virus was public; that two unvaccinated wildlife carers came into contact with the virus and unfortunately died.  Since then, it has become a requirement for all people involved in the handling of flying foxes and bats to be vaccinated against rabies.\n\n The virus has only been found in the four major species of Flying Fox and in one species of Microbat.\n\n  ABL is incredibly rare, for instance, in the Spectacled Flying Fox, the species found here in Far North Queensland, only one every 100,000 carries the virus and they are not asymptomatic.  This means that the Bat will fall to the symptoms of the virus and die within seven days, giving very little time to spread it to other bats or to humans.\n\n ABL is transmitted through scratches or bites that break the skin.  Just being in proximity to bat colonies, or coming into contact with their faeces/urine, does not pose a risk.\n\n  There is no treatment however for ABL, only prevention.  You must have your three rabies vaccine shots to be able to handle bats, but only handle if necessary.  Do not handle bats unless they are in need of assistance due to injury, orphaned of paralysis tick.  And if possible, leave all handling to an experienced rescuer.\n\n  If you are not vaccinated and are concerned you have been exposed to ABL you will need to contact your GP and get three post exposure shots.  Although ABL is incredibly rare, your safety comes first.\n\n  If you see a bat that you think has ABL or has been injured in some way or has been orphaned, contact FNQ Wildlife Rescue."

      "question": "Microbats are living in my roof, am I at risk?",
      "answer": "No, there are 44 species of microbats in Australia and only a handful prefer the safety of eaves space to roost, none of these species have been found to carry ABL."
    },
    {
      "question": "I have Flying Foxes roosting in my garden, can I get ABL from their droppings?  What about Microbat droppings?",
      "answer": "No, there is no information to suggest that ABL can be transmitted through bat droppings.  ABL is closely related to Rabies and research concerning Rabies shows that it can’t be transmitted by faeces."
    },
    {
      "question": "I’ve been bitten by a bat, what should I do?",
      "answer": "Contact your GP and arranged to get your post exposure vaccinations.  It is highly unlikely that the bat would have ABL but you can never be too sure. \n\n Flying Foxes and microbats do not go out of their way to bite people, they only come into contact with humans when they need to be taken into care because of injury/becoming orphaned.  So the only people who should be handling the bat, should be vaccinated, experienced handlers."
    },
    {
      "question": "A Microbat has come in through the window and hit the ceiling fan, what should I do?",
      "answer": "Call FNQ Wildlife Rescue and they will arrange a rescuer to collect it.  Keep an eye on it and make sure you know where it is when the rescuer arrives or if you have a cloth or small box, put it over the bat.  They feel safe in confined dark places and if injured, will calm down if covered."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are bats blind?",
      "answer": "Micro bats, or the bats whom use echo location, have a limited ability to see. They can make out shapes and shades from a distance. Once an item is right in their face they can see with some detail.\n\n Flying Foxes, have daytime sight as good a humans and in full colour. At night they have exceptional sight in the grey colour scale. Flying Foxes have no echo location and use sight for navigation and locating food."
